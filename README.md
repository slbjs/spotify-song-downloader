## ⚡ What Is This?

A minimal yet powerful **Spotify music search tool** that allows users to:
- 🔍 Search songs by name
- 🎵 View song metadata (title, artist, album, duration, year)
- 📥 Instantly download the song (via API integration)
- 🎧 Open the song directly in Spotify

All without needing to install anything — fully static, fully client-side!
